Smart Contracts: self executing sets of instructions, without third parties.
-Oracles bring data into the blockchain, or execute some external type of computation.
Therefore, blockchain can talk to the real world.
-
--- Basic Solidity Memory, Storage, and Calldata---
- Places you can store data in solidity:
	- Stack- 
	---> Memory- Temporary vaariables that only exist during the transaction/ when function is called
	---> Storage- Permanent variables that can be modified (stay in the blockchain forever)
	---> Calldata- Temporary vaariables that only exist during the transaction/ when function is 
	               called
	- Code- 
	- Logs- 
- Structs mappings and arrays (including strings which is an array of bytes) need to be given the memory
  or calldata keyword.
- EVM compatible blockchains- you can deploy solidity smart contracts in them. e.g Avalanche, Phantom,
  Polygon
- Contract in solidity is similar to classes in other programming languages.
- Types in Solidity:
	- uint256
	- string
	- byte
	- mapping
	- address
	- function
	e.t.c
- To create a new type, we can use a struct
-----L3:Storage Factory-----
Learning Outcomes:
- Deploying a SimpleStorage.sol contract that will deploy and interact with other contracts itself.
- Importing
- Inheritance e.t.c
